 INTRODUCTION
------------

The MIT-projects repository contains all the codding assignments developed as part of the Professional Certificate in Coding: Women's Cohort (April 2021) provided by MIT.
The repository is split into weeks, and it includes all the source files for each assignment.

REQUIREMENTS
------------
The code for the current assignments only requires access to a browser.

ASSIGNMENTS PER WEEK
------------
 * Week 2: During this week, we learned the basic concepts of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
 
 	***Assignments***
 
	- *Hellow World* This was the first HTML page created using basic HTML elements and CSS.
	- *Move Ball* Code that animates a ball moving and changing direction and color as soon as it reaches an edge.
	- *Shapes* Code that displays a series of shapes that helped to understand better the basic concepts of CSS.
	
 * Week 3: During this week, we learned about the Mental Model of Computing Operations. It includes an introduction to Variables and their scope, Basic Data Types, Casting Types, and Function Declaration Vs. Function Expression.
 
 	***Assignments*** 
 
	- *Projectile* We need to use the browser console. Typing **factory(n)** will create the *n* amount of balls and **update()** will make them move.
	- *Random Walk* The page will display three balls moving randomly and changing colors when hitting the edge of the area where they are moving.
	
 * Week 4: During this week, we worked more with Variables, Arrays, Objects, Primitive Types, as well as we learned about Basic Looping.
 
	 ***Assignments:***
 
	- *Pac-Man:* This code emulates the movement of Pac-Man side to side, and it will change directions once it had reached the edge of the screen. To start the movement, click on the Pac-Man image.
	
 * Week 5: During this week, we worked with Array Manipulation and Scope.
 
	 ***Assignments:***
 
	- *Walk Boston:* This code displays the name and salary of the top 5 people with the highest salary in Boston after iterating and sorting a JSON object with more than 20k records. 
	
 * Week 6: During this week, we worked with Callback Functions.
 
	 ***Assignments:***
